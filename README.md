# TitusJavaBlastModel
Example blast simulation for ARA interview process

This is an embarrassingly simple model of an explosive blast and the effect it has on a wall nearby.

The goal of this code is to demonstrate familiarity with modeling, OOP, visualization, and other coding techniques.

I did not have time to bring this code up to my own expectations of professional code, so please forgive the inefficiency and disorganization apparent in the code.

The included png was pulled from the fema.gov website, figure 4-3 from a chapter on explosive blasts which is publicly published on the website.
The png was included as partial validation of the utility of the model. The graphs produced by the model somewhat reproduce the expected curves in the figure.
